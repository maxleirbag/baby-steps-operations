# Hello, human

# The C9 content refers to the subject: 
# MATHEMATICAL SERIES

# From now on, you will guide yourself throught branches to see different examples of exercises for each subject 
# for example: baby-steps-operations/EX1C9 contains only that exercise, with a screenshot to describe what operation the program is solving


# Hopefully the examples will contribute to your learning as they did to mine
